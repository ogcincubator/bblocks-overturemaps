This\n            is different than the level column which is used to indicate z-ordering\n            of elements and negative values may be above ground.\n          type: boolean\n        num_floors:\n          description: Number of above-ground floors of the building or part.\n          type: integer\n          exclusiveMinimum: 0\n        num_floors_underground:\n          description: Number of below-ground floors of the building or part.\n          type: integer\n          exclusiveMinimum: 0\n        min_height:\n          description: The height of the bottom part of building in meters.
