  "description": "The Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is a universal framework for structuring and matching map data across systems.\nGERS, coupled with Overture datasets, is a potential standard for identifying and referencing the physical and\nconceptual entities we've defined in our world. It's also a mechanism that can simplify the integration and exchange of\ndata layers.\n\nGERS provides stable identifiers called GERS IDs for real-world geospatial entities across data releases and maintains\nconsistency when entities appear in multiple source datasets.",
