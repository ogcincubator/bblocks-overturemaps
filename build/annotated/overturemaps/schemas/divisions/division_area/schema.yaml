title: division_area
description: 'Division areas are polygons that represent the land or maritime area
  covered by a division.

  Each division area belongs to a division which it references by ID, and for which
  the division area provides an area polygon. For ease of use, every division area
  repeats the subtype, names, country, and region properties of the division it belongs
  to.'
