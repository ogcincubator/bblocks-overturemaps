The Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is a universal framework for structuring and matching map data across systems.
GERS, coupled with Overture datasets, is a potential standard for identifying and referencing the physical and
conceptual entities we've defined in our world. It's also a mechanism that can simplify the integration and exchange of
data layers.

GERS provides stable identifiers called GERS IDs for real-world geospatial entities across data releases and maintains
consistency when entities appear in multiple source datasets.
