  "abstract": "Addresses are geographic points used for locating businesses and individuals. The rules, fields, and fieldnames of an address can vary extensively between locations. We use a simplified schema to capture worldwide address points. This initial schema is largely based on the OpenAddresses (www.openaddresses.io) project.\nThe address schema allows up to 5 \"admin levels\". Rather than have field names that apply across all countries, we provide an array called \"address_levels\" containing the necessary administrative levels for an address.",
